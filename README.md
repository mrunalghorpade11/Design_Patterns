# Design_Patterns
These are some of the design patters I studied as part of my Summer 2020 Design Patterns workshop.

## Adapter Pattern
Adapter Pattern is a Structural Pattern in GoF Design Patterns Book
It is used when a client class has to use another class (adaptee) that it cannot recognize. This unfamiliar class is wrapped inside another class (adapter), and enables the client to use the functionality of the adaptee.
